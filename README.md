If you‚Äôd like to contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Submit a pull request.

**Note:**  
If you want to set up the project for local development, check out the [`version1`](https://github.com/areysid/Discord-Clone/tree/version1) branch which comes with extra local setup instructions and may be easier to run locally.
